### Development Workflows



## üéØ How to Use These Guides

### Choose the Right Guide
1. **Identify your specific problem** - What exactly are you trying to achieve?
2. **Find the matching guide** - Look for guides that address your specific use case
3. **Check prerequisites** - Ensure you have the required knowledge and tools
4. **Follow the solution** - Implement the provided solution step-by-step

### Guide Structure
Each guide follows this structure:

```
Problem Statement ‚Üí Solution Overview ‚Üí Prerequisites ‚Üí Step-by-step Solution ‚Üí Best Practices ‚Üí Related Guides
```

### Adaptation Guidelines
- **Modify for your environment** - Adapt paths, thresholds, and configurations
- **Test in safe environments** - Always test scripts before production use
- **Add error handling** - Enhance scripts with appropriate error handling
- **Document customizations** - Keep track of your modifications

## üîß Common Patterns

### Monitoring Pattern
```bash
# 1. Collect data
rfstat /path --format json --quiet > data.json

# 2. Analyze data
threshold_check=$(jq -r '.total_size > 1073741824' data.json)

# 3. Take action
if [[ "$threshold_check" == "true" ]]; then
    send_alert "Directory exceeds 1GB"
fi
```

### Analysis Pattern
```bash
# 1. Gather statistics
rfstat /path --format json --quiet > stats.json

# 2. Extract insights
jq -r '.file_types | to_entries | sort_by(.value.total_size) | reverse' stats.json

# 3. Generate report
generate_report stats.json > analysis_report.md
```

### Automation Pattern
```bash
# 1. Validate inputs
[[ -d "$TARGET_PATH" ]] || exit 1

# 2. Perform analysis
rfstat "$TARGET_PATH" --format json --quiet > /tmp/analysis.json

# 3. Process results
process_results /tmp/analysis.json

# 4. Cleanup
rm -f /tmp/analysis.json
```

## üìã Best Practices

### Script Development
- **Start simple** - Begin with basic functionality, then add features
- **Test thoroughly** - Test with various directory structures and edge cases
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide meaningful error messages
- **Log operations** - Keep audit trails of automated operations

### Production Deployment
- **Use configuration files** - Avoid hardcoded values in scripts
- **Implement monitoring** - Monitor the monitoring scripts themselves
- **Set up alerting** - Alert when automation fails
- **Plan for maintenance** - Regular updates and health checks

### Security Considerations
- **Principle of least privilege** - Run with minimal required permissions
- **Validate inputs** - Sanitize and validate all input parameters
- **Secure credentials** - Use secure methods for storing credentials
- **Audit access** - Log and monitor access to sensitive directories
